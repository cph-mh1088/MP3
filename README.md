What type/s of regression have you applied?
I've applied three types of regression: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression

Which were the challenges?
Dealing with outliers in the data set
Choosing the degree for polynomial regression

How accurate is your solution?
Multiple Linear Regression R2: ~0.54
Linear Regression R2: ~0.50
Polynomial Regression R2: ~0.50

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?
Experiment with different features and their combinations for better input to the models.
Fine-tune hyperparameters or try other regression techniques.
Address outliers more systematically, maybe exploring their impact on different models.
